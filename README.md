Currently have arduino program written for read and write rgb values
  Have not tested effectiveness as I did not have access to hardware
  Not sure if I have all the necessary outputs determined
Still trying to figure out how to push updates to github, and I do not currently see my arduino program
  will continue to try to push program
I have downloaded pygame onto the VM, but do not understand how to use it
  I will continue to reference Ch. 2 of pygame to try to answer my questions
